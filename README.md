## Technical Architecture

### Backend
- **Phoenix Framework**: Web framework and LiveView for real-time updates
- **Ecto**: Database ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Tesla**: HTTP client for API integrations
- **Ueberauth**: OAuth authentication with Google
- **GenServer**: Background polling for bot status updates

### Integrations
- **Google Calendar API**: Event synchronization
- **Recall.ai API**: Meeting bot management and transcription
- **OpenAI API**: AI content generation
- **LinkedIn API**: Social media posting (simulated)

### Key Modules
- `SMG.Integrations.GoogleCalendar`: Calendar sync and event management
- `SMG.Integrations.RecallAI`: Bot creation and management
- `SMG.Services.RecallPoller`: Background polling for bot status
- `SMG.AI.ContentGenerator`: AI-powered content creation
- `SMG.Services.SocialMediaPoster`: Social media publishing

## Development Notes

### Shared Recall.ai Account
Since this uses a shared Recall.ai account:
- The system uses polling instead of webhooks for bot status updates
- Each bot is tracked by its unique ID to avoid conflicts
- The polling service runs every 30 seconds to check for updates

### Database Schema
- `users`: User accounts linked to Google OAuth
- `google_accounts`: Multiple Google accounts per user
- `calendar_events`: Synced calendar events with meeting metadata
- `social_posts`: Generated social media content with status tracking

### Security Considerations
- OAuth tokens are securely stored and refreshed automatically
- API keys are loaded from environment variables
- User data isolation ensures privacy between accounts
- All sensitive information is properly encrypted

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Google Calendar not syncing**:
   - Check that the Google Calendar API is enabled
   - Verify OAuth scopes include calendar access
   - Ensure the access token is valid

2. **Recall.ai bot not joining**:
   - Verify the API token is correct
   - Check that the meeting link is valid
   - Ensure the meeting is scheduled in the future

3. **AI content generation failing**:
   - Check OpenAI API key and credits
   - Verify the transcript URL is accessible
   - Review the OpenAI API rate limits

### Logs and Debugging
- Check logs for API responses and errors
- Use `mix phx.server` with debug logging enabled
- Monitor the Recall poller GenServer for bot status updates

## Next Steps

Potential enhancements:
- Real-time transcript streaming during meetings
- More social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram)
- Custom content templates and branding
- Analytics and engagement tracking
- Team collaboration features
- Advanced AI prompt customization

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the application logs for error details
2. Verify all API keys and credentials are correct
3. Ensure all external services (Google, Recall.ai, OpenAI) are operational
4. Review the troubleshooting section above

**Note**: This application is designed for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, additional security measures, error handling, and monitoring should be implemented.
